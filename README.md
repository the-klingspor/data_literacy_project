## The Severity of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Terms of Excess Mortality and the Influence of Vaccinations

This repository is used for our 21/22 data literacy project on excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. We introduce the P-score as comparable measure of excess deaths. The cumulative P-scores of various countries over a longer time frame are then used as targets for Linear Regression. Our goal is to analyze the relationship between various demographic factors and excess mortality. Finally, the introduction of effective vaccines was an advancement saving the lives of millions of people. To illustrate this, we model the joint distribution of the amount of people fully vaccinated and P-scores using Kernel Density Estimation.
